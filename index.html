<p>Hello, we are Pavan, Harshit and Prateek from Clay. We’ve spent the last six yrs at Meesho, a YC-backed startup and India’s largest lifestyle e-commerce company. While there, we saw the value of creator content in solving consumer shopping problems up close. We are building a solution for lifestyle creators in fashion, home & beauty to help them create shoppable content at zero cost.</p>

<p>There are ~10M lifestyle creators globally, with median earnings of $10k / year. We believe both of these numbers are significantly capped by the challenges of commerce content creation and distribution. In order to create good content, they have to buy the product, wait for it to ship, set up the photo shoot, and sometimes even hire a model. This takes away time from their primary expertise - curation & styling. And because they can’t create shoppable content, they also struggle to monetise these skills.</p>

<p>To solve this, we want to use the emerging AI capabilities to generate lifestyle content without the need for an actual product or a photo shoot. We'd also like to create an affiliate program and a consumer destination for creators to distribute and monetise their content, beyond traditional social media.</p>

<p>If we do this well, the world will have millions of people who could earn a living as lifestyle experts by inspiring consumers.</p>
