‘Growth solves all problems’ is a common adage. Everybody understands that it’s the most important aspect of running a business, but not everyone understands how it’s done. Since writing brings clarity, I wanted to write this essay to dissect and better understand the levers that have helped Meesho grow so aggressively over the last 3 years. 

But first, here’s what Meesho achieved in terms of growth,

But why scale aggressively? Why not wait to set the right processes and plug leakages before going berserk on growth? Hard reality is that competitive threats are everywhere. Being no. 1 player is a strategic advantage - especially in a winner-takes-most or winner-takes-all market.


To be clear, timing is no-doubt important. It doesn’t make sense to scale when you don’t have the right product that solves an important problem for the target market. Scaling before Product-Market-Fit (PMF) could be detrimental since you will end up wasting crucial resources on something that users don’t care about (and hence, don’t care to pay for). At this stage, 100% focus on building the right product is the most appropriate strategy. 


Now let’s get to ‘how’ of it - what does it take to scale aggressively? I think the following three boxes need to be checked off. (yes, ALL of them - that’s why building a company is so hard)

a) Strong Product-Market Fit: You’ve a product that customers are willing to pay for.

b) Good Channel-Model Fit: Biz. model is able to pay for Customer Acquisition Cost.

c) Amazing Team & Culture: To make progress on multiple fronts, in parallel.

Let’s discuss each of them in detail.

Product-Market-Fit

We have discussed that achieving PMF is a prerequisite to scale. But the concept is slightly more nuanced - that PMF is not a 0 or 1 stage. There’s definitely a point where everything - from acquisition to monetisation - starts becoming easier but the work doesn’t stop there. 

Product needs continuous improvement to expand the market from early adopters to mainstream users. 

The below visualisation from www.growthengblog.com says it all - this is how one should budget efforts on product improvements vs. distribution. 


At Meesho, we use a flywheel framework to refine our product. It took us 3 years to frame it well but we’re finally there. Fundamentally, Meesho helps its users earn income and build a strong social identity. Both income and identity are strongly correlated with sales on the platform, which in turn is a function of experience on the platform - quality, price, variety and delivery. 

When we improve experience, our users are able to generate more sales. More sales lead to more suppliers, which again leads to improvement in all experience levers due to increased competition. You see? Continuously working on experience has a compounding effect on our growth, making Meesho a very attractive platform for the users.

Meesho Flywheel


Key take-away is that you should develop a good grasp of the ‘input / output’ equation for your business. Once you’ve this clarity, prioritisation of ‘what to build’ becomes much easier and accurate. But obviously, you will never have this clarity on day 1. To achieve this, you need a good product development process that optimises for learning. 

Model Channel Fit

Model-channel-fit doesn’t get as much PR as product-market-fit, but it’s an equally important lever. The concept is simple - your business model should pay for the product’s distribution cost. Without this, you can get initial traction but you can’t build a sustainable business. 

You should definitely read Brain Balfour’s article on this topic. In nutshell, it explains how different companies fall on different ends of the monetisation x distribution spectrum. For example, most social media companies monetise through Ads and user Lifetime-Value (LTV) is not enough to pay for paid acquisition, hence virality is the most sustainable channel for growth. Similarly for enterprise companies like Infosys, in-person sales is the only effective method to sell hence it’s impossible for them to develop a freemium monetisation model. Here’re more examples:


Channel fit is at the very core of Meesho’s growth. There’s a reason why Meesho’s growth trajectory has a high overlap with ‘WhatsApp and mobile internet’ growth trajectory. 

Without WhatsApp, our users couldn’t find end customers scalably, Before WhatsApp, homepreneurs had to organise kitty parties / offline events to acquire customers.

Without FB / WhatsApp / YouTube penetration, it was difficult for any company to acquire home-makers (Meesho’s core TG) at scale.


In short, without ‘WhatsApp and mobile internet’ penetration, Meesho growth was not possible. High cost of customer acquisition (CAC) would have made the growth unsustainable.

Amazing Team & Culture

Finally, the third most important pillar to build a high growth company - Amazing Team & Culture. Most first time managers don’t appreciate the importance but failure in this area is the saddest of all outcomes - you had the vision, you had a great product with a sustainable distribution channel but still you lose out to competition. 

Team + Culture gives execution leverage. A company designed to out-execute competitors will win the market even though they’re not the first to enter. Here’s a quote from one of the greatest players that does justice to the argument.


At Meesho, we have been very cognizant about building a great team from the very start. We have never hired anyone without 3-4 rounds of discussions + assignment + reference check (okay, we did some desperate hiring but it always turned out to be a waste of time). No matter how smart the candidate is, we reject if we feel the person will not fit-in culturally.

Ultimately, building a team is also best explained through a flywheel. It’s an iterative process that compounds over time as you invest in the right direction. Here’s how we think about it:


Disclaimer

Building a high growth company is very difficult - lots of moving parts. Above mentioned levers are important but not exhaustive. And even for the mentioned levers, a single article can’t do justice to the depth of the topics. 

But hopefully, I will write follow up articles which provide depth into each of the above building blocks. Until then, goodbye!
